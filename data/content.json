    "whyStarted": "I’m an aspiring entrepreneur working on an iOS app startup to create innovative solutions that make people’s lives easier. However, starting a tech company requires significant funding for development, marketing, and scaling. Inspired by the original Million Dollar Homepage, I launched this 2025 version to raise initial funds for my startup by selling pixels at $1 each.",
    "vision": "With the funds raised, I plan to build an iOS app that revolutionizes how people interact with technology in their daily lives. The app will focus on [insert app idea or focus, e.g., productivity, education, or social impact], aiming to deliver real value to users worldwide. By purchasing pixels, you’re not just buying a piece of this page—you’re supporting a dream to create something meaningful.",
    "howHelp": "Every pixel you buy directly contributes to the development of this iOS app. For just $1 per pixel (minimum 100x100 for $10), you can claim a spot on this page, add your own image or video (with Premium), and be part of this journey. Let’s build something amazing together!"
